Funny how this totally makes no sense with what i wrote above. I know.

I am absolutely sick of companies,programs and operating systems tracking me. Im seeing network traffic going to google analytics and tons of firefox domains (which is advertisted as an open source PRIVACY CENTRIC webbrowser) even my lightweight open source (ish) operating system Arch Linux is tracking me. Yes the domain archlinux.org is contacted every minute and i'm through with it. 

I am sick of my open source note program(QOwnNotes) sending a 'heartbeat' just to let the developer know im using his program. Im sick i need to click a button on every program to disable tracking and telemetry. Im treated as a simple moron by these companies and persons. Im sick of compiling programs for the sake of compiling because that way you trust the source code. I just want things to work and go on with my life instead of waiting 30 minutes to install some bloody program i dont care about. All our lives are binded by using soooo many goddamn programs. Twitter, instagram, mail client, terminal, webbrowser and media player. Most people want to go on with their lives instead of picking the 'best' program and feeding their illusion that they're better than other people. The normal/average people who have no idea how technology works.

Im am totally sick of rambox (open source telegram, whatsapp, mail all in 1 program) that has a privacy policy saying "we do not track you". Then the second line says the use google analytics to track you. Yes ofcourse, legally you are right, but you are a piece of shit.

Im sick of this analytics is the meme analytics is the hype, lets all use google analytics. WAIT lets create an OPEN environment with open source called piwik/matomo and track what you click on what you like. Standard should be opted in, but that way companies don't make money ofcourse. People are stupid and will ever be treated as such when handling technology.
No wonder the top richests persons are all in tech: Bill Gates, Snapchat founder, Amazon founder, Facebook founder.
